# More Heat!

**University of Regensburg**  
_Master Thesis Project_

---

## Overview

**More Heat!** is my master thesis project developed at the University of Regensburg.
This project was created using Unity.

## Goal of this project

Previous research in this field has already examined the effects of virtual stimuli, such as flames and ice, and the influence of the virtual environment on the human body. These studies have shown that visual and auditory stimuli in Virtual Reality can have physiological effects.

The aim of this study is to investigate how the representation of one's own avatar in a virtual environment affects perceived and actual skin temperature, as well as thermal comfort in various scenarios. Additionally, the participants in the resulting study will be examined regarding their immersion ability and personality using questionnaires to determine if trends can be identified in the context of thermal perception.
